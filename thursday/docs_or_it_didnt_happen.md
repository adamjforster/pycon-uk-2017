- Content strategy:
  - Lookup documentarians (Wrtie the Docs).
  - Asking the right questions in advance can save a lot of time.
    - Document the things that matter:
      - Need-to-know docs (you don't need to know anything).
      - Five-ws:
        - Who are the readers?
        - What do they need to know? What do they want to know?
        - When do they need to now it?
        - Where is / should the information be consumed? Error messages are
          legit docs!
        - Why do they care?
  - Examples:
    - Gnome asks who you are and points you to the right place (help.gnome.org)
    - Arch Linux wiki, difficult to browse but users are likely to search.
    - Minishift README (TODO: gh minishift link), short, points to correct
      places (acts as a portal).
    - Minishift troubleshooting, warning messages link to further info in the
      docs.

- DevOps for docs:
  - Integrate with development procedures, you already have that tooling.
  - Treat docs as code, put your docs in the repo.
  - Modularise your content, if you need to scroll more than a couple of
    times it's too long! More than 3 or 4 sub-heading is too many.
    - It's easier to move and restructure modular content.
  - Use ticketing for your docs, just like your code.
  - Automatic build and deploy.
  - Automate testing of your docs: Hemmingway, Emender

- Community spirit:
  - Make docs a requirement.
  - Have contribution guidelines.
  - Provide templates.
