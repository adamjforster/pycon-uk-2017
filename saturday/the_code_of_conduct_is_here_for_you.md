- Two hardest problems in tech:
  1. People.
  2. Convincing others that that is the case.
  
- Codes of conduct:
  - Make it easier to report issues.
  - Build trust that reports will be handled.
  - Make it explict how people are expected to behave.
  
- Reports are handled via a defined process.
  - This requires consideration of all involved parties.
  - Intent isn't magic, but it does matter.
  
- CoC myths:
  1. There is no problem (why fix what isn't broken?)
  2. It's againt freedom of speech
  3. Enforcement will be hard and ruthless.
  4. People should just speak up for themselves.

- Not everyone will get the outcome that they want, but they should
  be taken seriously.
