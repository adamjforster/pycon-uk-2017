- What happens when a project comes to an end?

- Get in the right mindset:
  - Don't commit to action too early.
  - Consider all the things you have learnt and acheieved along the way.
  - Count your users (record your metrics).
  - Remember that you are you (not your users, bosses, etc ...).

- Make a plan:
  - Do this collaboratively with your collegues.
  - Stop onboarding, close the funnel.
  - Inventory your comms channels.
  - Define an escalation strategy.
  - Define your schedule.

- Day the right things in the right ways:
  - Let people down easily, be calm, gentle, but direct.
  - Remember that it's not about you!
  - Provide the facts:
    - What is happening?
    - When will it happen?
    - What does the user need to do?
  - You don't have to answer why, this isn't a negotiation.
  - But you do need to say thank you.
