- Interviews ask for online profiles and open source contributions, optimising
  for people with free time (privilege).
  
- How can I make my env more inclusive?

- Inclusion is recognising that people are different, diversity is inviting
  people without providing for them.
  
- Privilege isn't wealth.

- Having privilege means that there are obstacles that you don't have to deal
  with.
  - Race
  - Gender
  - Health (physical / mental)
  - Family
  - Education
  - Religion
  - Sexual orientation

- What would your job be like without these privileges?

- It's not bad to have privilege, but it is bad to ignore that you have it.

- The goal: be an **active** ally for people who have different levels of
  privilege.

- How?
  1. Introspect: understand your own privilege.
  2. Listen & learn: Listen to people who don't have your privileges.
  3. Speak & take action:
    - Cut out bad jokes / language.
    - Call out when others do it.
    - Call out stereotypes, ask why people believe them.
    - Challenge the hidden assumptions in the environment.
  4. Persevere: it takes time, there is no silver bullet.

- Listening to someone does not mean you have their experience.

- Practice empathy, don't preach.

- Calling out is powerful, especially when you call out some who looks like
  you.

- You will get it wrong sometimes, make sure you learn from it. Don't be
  scared to apologise.
  
- Like a technical skill there should be continual improvement.
